hits hard , chill and giggly . a really nice cherry like flavor . amazing . literally the best . amazing sex too .  chill at work.

second time buying: doesn’t make me hungry, makes me kinda trippy though and all confusion . paranoid a little at work when communication with other employees but definitely made me productive at the job",0,2020-09-23T22:23:56.289Z,o........p,6353839,https://public.leafly.com/avatars/29.png,https://public.leafly.com/avatars/29.png,bcdb860b-e2c5-4b4d-a8d9-3f5e549ff4a3,2020-09-23T22:23:56.289Z,o........p,

I smoked a .3 and passed out on my friends kitchen counter. constantly very thirsty and a pretty dry mouth too but after the rocky start, the euphoria and giggly happiness sets in. everything will be hilarious for a few hours but I had serious trouble sleeping and started imagining things that weren't happening. Not exactly hallucinations but believing illogical things.

Again this strain is seriously strong.

There are heavy indicas, electrifying sativas etc, but if I had to choose one strain to smoke forever, it would surely be Wedding Cake. It's probably too relaxing for wake-and-bake, but I'm not a wake-and-baker, so for everything else this is perfect: smooth but not stupefying, it makes you giggly, it soothes muscle pain, it relieves anxiety, it's good for sex... and best of all, I don't think I've ever had a bad batch. Even very average grows are good stuff.
